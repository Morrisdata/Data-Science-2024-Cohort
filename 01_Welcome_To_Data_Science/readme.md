### Class 1: Lets get rolling! - Intro to Data Science

**Student Prework**
Before this lesson you should already be able to:
* Define basic data types used in object-oriented programming
* Recall the Python syntax for lists, dictionaries, and functions
* Create files and navigate directories using the command line interface (for your specific environment)

**After this lesson, you will be able to:**
* Describe the roles and components of a successful learning environment
* Define data science and the data science workflow
* Apply the data science workflow to meet your classmates
* Setup your development environment and review python basics

**Topics/Highlights**
* Welcome from General Assembly!
* Course overview ([slides/01_course_overview.pdf](https://github.com/Morrisdata/DS/blob/master/01_Welcome_To_Data_Science/GA%20Data%20Science%202024%20-%2001%20Welcome%20To%20Data%20Science.pdf))
* What is data science ([slides](slides/01_data_science_intro.pdf))
* Data Science workflow ([slides](slides/01_data_science_intro.pdf))
	* [Exercise (Apply the workflow)](other/workflow_exercise.md)
* Hands-on with the Data Science Dev Environment (Anaconda, Spyder IDE, iPython notebooks)
* Discuss the course project: [requirements](project/README.md) and [example projects](/project/project_examples/README.md)
	* Types of data ([slides](slides/01_types_of_data.pdf)) and [public data sources](project/public_data.md)
	* [GA's student gallery of projects](https://gallery.generalassemb.ly)

<!--		* Our very own Kevin McAlear's [Hater News DAT project](http://haternews.co/?network=twitter) on the GA gallery
-->
**Homework:**
* Due Dec 7
	* Read through the information about the course project information to familiarize yourself with the [requirements](project/README.md) and [example projects](/project/project_examples/README.md).  Start thinking about what question you would like to answer in your project.
		* Types of data ([slides](slides/01_types_of_data.pdf)) and [public data sources](project/public_data.md)
* Due Dec 12
	* Review each concept and each line of code in these files of python code: [00_python_beginner_workshop.py](code/00_python_beginner_workshop.py) and [00_python_intermediate_workshop.py](code/00_python_intermediate_workshop.py). Complete the coding exercises in the files: If you don't feel comfortable with any of the content (excluding the "requests" and "APIs" sections), you should spend some time before July 6 practicing Python.  Use your resources such as documentation, searches, the class Slack to get help if you get stuck.  Here are some additional resources:
	    * [Introduction to Python](http://introtopython.org/) does a great job explaining Python essentials and includes tons of example code.
	    * If you like learning from a book, [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/html-270/) has useful chapters on strings, lists, and dictionaries.
	    * If you prefer interactive exercises, try these lessons from [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python): "Python Lists and Dictionaries" and "A Day at the Supermarket".
	    * If you have more time, try missions 2 and 3 from [DataQuest's Learning Python](https://www.dataquest.io/course/learning-python) course.
	    * If you've already mastered these topics and want more of a challenge, try solving [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) number 1 (decoding a message)

**Resources:**
* For a useful look at the different types of data scientists, read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) (32 pages).
* For some thoughts on what it's like to be a data scientist, read these short posts from [Win-Vector](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2012/09/on-being-a-data-scientist/) and [Datascope Analytics](http://datascopeanalytics.com/what-we-think/2014/07/31/six-qualities-of-a-great-data-scientist).
* Quora has a [data science topic FAQ](https://www.quora.com/Data-Science) with lots of interesting Q&A.
