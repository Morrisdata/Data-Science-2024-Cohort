    "- The **\"naive\" assumption** of Naive Bayes (that the features are conditionally independent) is critical to making these calculations simple.\n",
    "- The **normalization constant** (the denominator) can be ignored since it's the same for all classes.\n",

    "Advantages of Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model training and prediction are very fast\n",
    "- Somewhat interpretable\n",
    "- No tuning is required\n",
    "- Features don't need scaling\n",
    "- Insensitive to irrelevant features (with enough observations)\n",
    "- Performs better than logistic regression when the training set is very small\n",

    "Disadvantages of Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicted probabilities are not well-calibrated\n",
    "- Correlated features can be problematic (due to the independence assumption)\n",
    "- Can't handle negative features (with Multinomial Naive Bayes)\n",
    "- Has a higher \"asymptotic error\" than logistic regression"
