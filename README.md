# Data Science Part-Time 10 Week Cohort
This Cohort is meant as an expedited ramp up on the skills for Data Science. The intent is to help someone break into Data Science. The material covered is in a crash course fashion and is by no means comprehensive. The materials covered are a "best of". 

Data Science has been evolving and shaping over the last decade and can be defined differently even within one company. Some may define it as AI and ML others as Data Engineering with Predictive Modeling. While others just grab-bag of Technical Project Management and Data Wrangling. 

The content in this class is meant to give a bootcamp styled foundational knowledge and application to begin a journey into the field of Data Science. 

The goal everyone should have in this class is to move the needle at least 1 or 2 points on the below self-evaluation. Teaching and mentoring is a proven way to grow or reinforce knowledge. Highly encourage study groups and/or volunteering to share on a subject of your interest related to course content or complimentary to it. Please reach out if you are interested in sharing or if you feel you are at a 4 or 5 volunteered presentations to fortify your own knowledge while sharing are welcome. 
Self Evaluation
* 0 - Do not know
* 1 - Aquiring knowledge ( studied or attempted in last 30 days)
* 2 - Can and have applied ~ 3x with use of reference material(notes, google, stackoverflow) < 80% of the time
* 3 - Can and have applied applied with little use of reference <20% of the time
* 4 - Can teach or mentor 
* 5 - Design, Optimize, Code Review, Improve

Class times
Tuesday PST: 4-7
Thursday PST:4-7

### PROJECT DATES
The 4 units will be accented with workstyled meetings.
- 12/21 Chipotle Obtain and Understand data update
- 1/16  Chiptle EDA with Python update & Final Project + Dataset proposal
- 1/30  Project EDA Brief, Linear regression Lunch and Learn(demo and knowledge share)
- 2/22 Proof of concept with tech team and executive sponsors.

  
- **Updating** your team on what you understand about the data.
- **Proposal** making a use case and seeking feedback from your team before moving forward.
- **Brief** Write up with stats about progress with project, blockers, challenges and refined scope
- **Lunch and Learn** informal setting to share what you know, hear something a new way, or actively learn as a teacher
- **Technical report** This is the final brief with more detail on how it was built, where there are issues either with data or code, what is still needed, why the approach was taken, what other options were considered, Next steps. This will have stats about the data that was excluded and a profile of what was included.
   **Executive Presentation a 1 page or less document in common terms that tell a narrative that answers the business questions, allows for business acumene detailed questions, and offers next steps to the relevent audience. Answers the question, "So what?"
