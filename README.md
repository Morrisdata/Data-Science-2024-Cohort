# Data Science Part-Time 10 Week Cohort
This Cohort is meant as an expedited ramp up on the skills for Data Science. The intent is to help someone break into Data Science. The material covered is in a crash course fashion and is by no means comprehensive. The materials covered are a "best of". 

Data Science has been evolving and shaping over the last decade and can be defined differently even within one company. Some may define it as AI and ML others as Data Engineering with Predictive Modeling. While others just grab-bag of Technical Project Management and Data Wrangling. 

The goal everyone should have in this class is to move the needle at least 1 or 2 points on the below self evaluation. Teaching and mentoring is a proven way to grow or reinforce knowledge. Highly encourage study groups and/or volunteering to share on a subject of your interest related to course content or complimentary to it. Please reach out if you are interested in sharing. 
Self Evaluation
* 0 - Do not know
* 1 - Aquiring knowledge ( studied or attempted in last 30 days)
* 2 - Can and have applied ~ 3x with use of reference material(notes, google, stackoverflow) < 80% of the time
* 3 - Can and have applied applied with little use of reference <20% of the time
* 4 - Can teach or mentor 
* 5 - Design, Optimize, Code Review, Improve
