# Data Science Part-Time 10 Week Cohort
This Cohort is meant as an expedited ramp up on the skills for data science. Each of these skill sets are a baseline that an individual can continue detailed research into. While not every aspect can be covered the tools learned will get someone up and running with Data Science methodology, coding, and practices.  For some in class this may seem to go very fast and be hard to keep up with, the advice is to do your best and use the class and resources as a roadmap for continued studies and learning. For these individuals it is OK if you do not master everything in the course the first time through, but it is important to keep track and be disciplined on what you need to come back to. Others in the class may be on the other end of the spectrum and have built API's or may be seasoned Python and R programmers or perhaps have a degree in mathematics and looking for programming. Your expertise will be invited and welcome to share during the parts of the course where you may have insight that I do not have in say deep level R programming. I encourage those individuals to ask for challenges or to be transparent on areas they struggle in. While we may not have time to get into things like Gridsearch, This may be an example of a stretch goal if you find you are wanting more than the part time content allows for.  The intent is to help someone break into Data Science. The material covered is in a crash course fashion and is by no means comprehensive. The materials covered are a "best of". 

Data Science has been evolving and shaping over the last decade and can be defined differently even within one company. Some may define it as AI and ML others as Data Engineering with Predictive Modeling. While others just grab back of Technical Project Management and Data Wrangling. 
It is up to an individual to work with other courses outside of this workshop in order to get a full breadth of knowledge.  If you have not already heard of these resources and are new to python I would use them in conjunction with what you learn here as they complement each other.

# Additional Python Training


# Python_for_Data(optional Prework)
* A look at the applications used and why
* What can you do with Python? Why not learn R or SPSS Modeler?
* Basic setup covered in [DataScience101](https://github.com/Morrisdata/DataScience101)

# Python for Data I
Download [Anaconda with python 3.6 or 7](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), Pycharm or code editor for exercises
