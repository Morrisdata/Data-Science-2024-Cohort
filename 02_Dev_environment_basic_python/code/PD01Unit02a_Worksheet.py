''' I like to call these variables. 
there are a few rules that I may break for the sake of speed, training and 
just my shorthand when I speak.'''
"""
Rules for identifiers

An identifier, also called a name, is a sequence of 
letters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ ) 

Rules:
1)    cannot start with a number          003test
2)    cannot have a space in the name     test script
3)    cannnot have a symbol               test#
4)    Python is case sensitive, x is not the same as X 
5)    Avoid underscores _
      double underscores (for example, __init__) have built in use cases
    
Cannot use Reservered words
False      class      finally    is         raise
None       continue   for        lambda     return
True       def        from       nonlocal   try
and        del        global     not        while
as         elif       if         or         with
assert     else       import     pass       yield
break      except     in         print


Style guidelines for identifiers
use lower case for variables
use underscores_between_words
meaningful names, ie age is better than a. 
    
I have been use things like x and a as identifiers in reality you will want
to have identifiers with more meaning. There is a balance between something like
tsrq1 = and Total_Sales_Revenue_Quarter_1 = something in the middle is better and
using acroynms works if they are understandable and standard at your business.
tot_sls_revQ1 or totsales_revq1 gives an idea of the balance
"""


# Objects

x = 10
x =3
"""
Properties of objects
3 defining properties: value, type, and identity.

    Value:    A value  "20", "abcdef", or 55.
    Type:     type of the object, such as integer or string.
    Identity: A unique identifier 
    
    Value: 20 
    type: integer 
    identifier:  125490909 
"""

x = (2 + 2)         # Create a new object with a value of 4, referenced by 'x'.
y = 'ABC'

print("x type is:", type(x))      # Print the type of the object.
print("x id is:",id(x))
print("y type is:", type(y))  # Create and print the type of a string object.

Common error: Missing parentheses
It is a good practice to ensure you have explicitly put together your logic
using parentheses. In more complex logic it is easy to forget a parentheses
or lose track and have them set up incorrectly

## MATH COMPRESSION
''' in math you often times have a value of x and then you want to add to that
value and have a new total'''
x = 10
x = x + 5
print(x)
'''
in python we can compress this statement down'''
x = 10
x += 5
print(x)


#-assignment/reassignment operators  
x = 10       #assignment
x += 5       #adds
x -= 5       #subtracts
x *= 5       #multiples
x /= 5       #divides

## EXERCISE
'''
Initial Markup (IMU) is the difference between the cost and selling price of an 
item when it is first introduced for sale. 
It is also called Initial Mark On, Markon or Markup. 

The formula for this calculation is: 
Selling price â€“ cost = Initial Markup Dollars. 

If a buyer brings in a line of jeans with a cost of 25 per pair and initially 
prices them to sell at 55 per pair, the Initial Markup is 30. 

1)Create an IMU calculator so that you can enter the cost of an item the sale
price and see the result

2) using boolean logic evaluate that the price has not exceed a 20% markup

''' PROJECT EXERCISE
Revisit your previous project script and consider how you might use 
Prompts, If then else, Math, and boolean to update your 
scores, find your averages and give recommendations and what you can add to
your resume or what you need to practice.

Could you use input with If then else to create a Quiz? Maybe later you can
begin grading the quiz. A good starting point is to take what you have already 
created and use prompts to make your scores dynamic.
Beyond this is creativity design and your own ideas.
