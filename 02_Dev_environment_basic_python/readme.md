### Class 2: Development Environment, Python Basics
We will be confirming that all students can connect to and have access to all applications, data, and python environments are working properly. 

There are several workbooks that can be reviewed and walked through. In class we will be reviewing Units on basic intro to Python and connecting to data through Python. 
There are however several Units to increase your Python Skills and continue building on. The units are built as a loop and allows for adding additional content as your knowledge grows. 

**Student Prework**
  Complete or near completion of python pre-work.
  Downloaded Chipotle Dataset.
  Created a repository for data that you will be storing and accessing.
  Connected with at least one client and one consultant in class.

**After this lesson, you will be able to:**
    Navigate applications used for development. 
    Execute an application from your desktop. 
    Connect to files such as Chipotle data. 
    Setup your development environment and review Python basics.

**Homework**
-- Connect to Chipolte Data and begin working through project Prompt
-- Bonus Build out your python skillbuilder to share with instructors or as a demo for the class
