**Chipotle EDA Update**
For this update use skills learned through EDA and statistics to create a descriptive narrative the flow into other questions you may have. 
If you are looking for inspiration try rewwriting course material using Chipotle Data, How many fun facts can you find? Flex using bar charts, scatteplots and other types of visualizations. 
Ask Who, What, Where, When, Why, Why? Why? Why? Why

**Proposal + dataset**
- Proposal should include
    1) What is the question you hope to answer?
    2) What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
    3) What do you know about the data so far?
    4) Why did you choose this topic?
- Characteristics of a good project question
    1) Clearly defined: The question can easily be summarized in a single statement ("Can we predict A based on B?").
    2) As simple as possible: The question has a narrow focus rather than broad goals.
    3) Reasonably available data: The question depends on data that is likely to be available in a "meaningful" quantity.
    4) Reasonable hypothesis: The question examines factors (B) that might actually be predictive of the outcome (A).

- You can present answers to these questions and a basic EDA to your data as a PDF from Jupyter notebook. 

- Students listening to proposal should be seeking to provide constructive feedback, insights, ideas, other questions or protips.
- Remember these are mock team meetings and teams sink or rise together. That student presenting needs your input.
