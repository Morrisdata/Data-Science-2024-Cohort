A draft of your project paper is due, along with the data, well-commented code, and visualizations. 
It should be written with a technical audience in mind. Your paper should include the following components:
-	Problem statement and hypothesis
-	Description of your data set and how it was obtained
-	Description of any pre-processing steps you took
-	What you learned from exploring the data, including visualizations
-	How you chose which features to use in your analysis
-	Details of your modeling process, including how you selected your models and validated them
-	Your challenges and successes
-	Possible extensions or business applications of your project
-	Conclusions and key learnings

Your peers and instructional team will be providing feedback. However, the paper should stand "on its own", and should not depend upon the reader remembering your first presentation. 
The easier your paper is to follow, the more useful feedback you will receive! As well, if your reviewers can actually run your code on the provided data, they will be able to give you better feedback on your code.


**Peer Review**
-	Read everything they wrote!
-	If they provided their data, review it and try to understand it.
-	Read their code and try to understand their thought process.
-	If their code can be run, try running it.
-	Spend at least one hour reviewing their project (including the time it takes to write the feedback).

Your feedback would ideally consist of:
- Strengths of their project (things you particularly like about it)
-	Comments about things you think could be improved
-	Questions about things you don't understand
-	Comments about their code
-	Links to resources or code snippets that might be useful to them
-	Suggestions for next steps
-	Guiding principle: Give feedback that would be helpful to you if it was your project!
You should take a quick glance through their project as soon as possible, to make sure you understand what they have given you and what files you should be reviewing. If you're unclear, ask them about it!


Your project repository on GitHub should contain the following:
-	Project paper: any format (PDF, Markdown, etc.)
-	Presentation slides: any format except for Keynote (PDF, PowerPoint, Google Slides, IPython Notebook, etc.)
-	Code: commented Python scripts, and any other code you used in the project
-	Visualizations: integrated into your paper and/or slides
-	Data: data files in "raw" or "processed" format
-	Data dictionary (aka "code book"): description of each variable, including units.


The update meeting or in class presentation. Can be run in Jupyter Notebooks. Powerpoint, or via a pager ie 3 or 6 pager for a non technical team. 
You can talk tech but be sure to explain it in not tech ways. Be prepared to answer the questions. So What? What do I do with this?

Logistics and tips for success (similar to last time)
-	Please submit a link to your repository (with slides) by 6pm on the day you are presenting.
-	Regardless of which day you are presenting, your repository should also contain the other required project components by 6pm on the last day of class.
-	You will have exactly 20 minutes to present, followed by 10 minutes of questions. Practice your presentation and time yourself!
-	Your presentation should start with a recap of the key information from the previous presentation (including your project question), but you should spend the majority of your presentation discussing what has happened since then.
-	If your presentation is too long, focus it around the most interesting aspects of your project, rather than trying to include every last detail.
-	Tell your story in an engaging fashion.
-	You are welcome to invite your friends and family members to attend.
